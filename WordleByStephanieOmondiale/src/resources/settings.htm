    <h1>Game Mode Settings</h1>
    <p>The application supports two game modes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Random Mode</strong>: In this mode, the game selects a random word from the word list, and the player must guess it within six attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Absurdle Mode</strong>: This mode dynamically adjusts the word list to keep the game challenging. The player has six attempts to narrow down and guess the word.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To choose a mode, use the appropriate command-line parameters or select the mode in the GUI.</p>
